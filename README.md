# Credit Risk Modeling in Python

This repository showcases my project on Credit Risk Modeling in Python, where I have developed a comprehensive approach to assessing and managing credit risk using advanced data science techniques. This project focuses on building models for the key components of the Expected Loss equation: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). The work adheres to industry standards and regulatory requirements, such as Basel II and Basel III, ensuring that the models are practical and compliant.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the entire end-to-end process of credit risk modeling, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and maintenance. The models are built using real-world data, providing an authentic representation of how these techniques are applied in the banking industry.

## Key Achievements

- **Comprehensive Credit Risk Models**: Developed robust models for PD, LGD, and EAD, using advanced statistical techniques and real-world data.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designed models that comply with Basel II and Basel III regulations, ensuring adherence to industry standards.
- **Full Model Lifecycle**: Covered all stages of model development, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and maintenance.
- **Advanced Statistical Techniques**: Implemented Weight of Evidence, Information Value, Fine and Coarse Classing, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and more.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed model performance using key metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Gini Coefficient, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Population Stability Index.
- **Scorecard Development**: Created a credit risk scorecard from scratch, demonstrating skills in model interpretation and practical implementation.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Managed complex datasets, transforming raw data into actionable insights ready for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied advanced statistical methods to refine and select the most impactful features for the models.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Built and validated models to high standards, ensuring they meet performance and compliance criteria.
- **Model Maintenance**: Developed strategies for ongoing model updates and maintenance to keep them effective over time.

## Resources Included

- **Jupyter Notebook Files**: Detailed code files illustrating the complete modeling workflow.
- **Supporting Materials**: Additional resources, including slides, documentation, and evaluation results to provide context and enhance understanding.

## Summary

This project highlights my ability to apply advanced data science techniques in a real-world context, focusing on credit risk modeling and regulatory compliance. The work reflects a deep understanding of the financial sectorâ€™s requirements and showcases my skills in developing, evaluating, and maintaining robust models for risk assessment.
